Note: A lot of bugs that I couldn't quite get fixed.
This serves as a good starting point/proof of concept, but the code itself is too clunky. I suggest rebuilding the codebase if this project is pursued.

Key Components:
-Adults, Childrens, and Elders, decisions are different as they have different amounts of attention span, extraversion, etc. Actions driven by personality traits and primitive desires(eg. hunger), also have happiness that changes based on if desires are being met by interactables
-Placable and movable interactables for NPCs to interact with
-GameState object that keeps a relative time scale for NPCs, can easily make and attatch scripts for analytics
